# Influence-Maximization-Project
Research project about influence maximization

This is a research project related with Influence maximization problem.

The project is written in JAVA.

Two influence models are implemented. They are IC model and SC model (SC model is my new defined model)
Algorithms of influence maximization includes greedy algorithm, MaximumDegree, DegreeDiscount and my new algorithm named best coverage algorithms.

This is a research project which results into a research paper that submitted to a journal.

Paper is titled "Introduce New Information Diffusion Model for Influence Maximization", which is accessible when it is published.
